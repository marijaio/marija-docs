title: How to use Marija

Marija is a data visualisation tool. It visualises data through network graphs,
a map and a timeline. It can help you find meaningful relationships in large amounts of data.

In this article we will explore the different features of Marija. We will import
a small CSV containing some emails. We will try to find out who is sending the
most emails and which people are often communicating with each other.

## Getting our CSV

You can download the CSV from [docs.marija.io/assets/articles/how-to-use-marija/emails.csv](/assets/articles/how-to-use-marija/emails.csv).

Let's take a quick look at our CSV:

![Emails CSV](/assets/articles/how-to-use-marija/emails-csv.png)

The CSV contains a list of emails. Each email has a sender, recipient, date,
subject and body. The subjects and bodies are automatically generated random text.

> Note that no relations are explicitly defined in the CSV. Marija will automatically identify these relations for us.

## Importing the CSV into Marija

First click on `Config`, then scroll down until you see `CSV Datasources`.
Then click on `Create CSV datasource`.

![Create CSV datasource](/assets/articles/how-to-use-marija/create-csv-datasource.png)

Follow the steps in the CSV datasource wizard to create the emails.csv datasource.
You should now see emails.csv listed under CSV datasources.

## Displaying our first graph

Click on `Show all items` to display all emails as a network graph. You can scroll
to zoom out.

To understand this graph, we zoom in on 3 nodes:

![Connectors explained](/assets/articles/how-to-use-marija/connectors-explained.png)

There are 2 purple round nodes here. These are objects. Each of them represents
exactly 1 row in our CSV.

There is also 1 square blue node. This is a connector. **Connectors are automatically
generated by Marija and are used to identify relations between objects.**

The blue connector in this example has the data `to: liam@email.com`. 2 Purple object nodes are
connected to it. This means that both of these object nodes are emails
that are written to liam@email.com.

Now zoom out again and look at the graph as a whole.

![Emails graph](/assets/articles/how-to-use-marija/emails-graph.png)

We see that some connector nodes appear to have a lot of connections. Those might
be important people in our network. Hover over them to display which email addresses
they signify.

## Improving our graph

Our graph has a problem: it creates connector nodes for senders, and it creates
connector nodes for recipients, but a sender and a recipient can be the same person.
It would be more useful to have connector nodes that represent a person,
regardless of whether it is a sender or a recipient.

To fix this, we will manually define a connector.

Open the config again and scroll to the `Active connectors` section. Here we find
our two connectors that were automatically recognized by Marija: `to` and `from`.
Now we will manually combine the both of them into one new connector, by dragging
the `from` field into the `to` connector.

{% include loopingVideo.html src="/assets/articles/how-to-use-marija/combining-connectors.mp4" %}

Now our graph looks much better.

To clean up our graph further, we can delete nodes that do not seem interesting.
There is one node on the right that is not connected to any other nodes.
Click on it to select it and then press the `Delete` button in the bottom toolbar.
>Note: Marija does not alter the underlying data! You only delete items from the visualised graph, not in your original dataset.

Hover on the `to, from` connector in the legend
in the top left to highlight the connectors. This gives us a clear overview of
all the people in our network.

![Emails graph improved](/assets/articles/how-to-use-marija/emails-graph-improved.png)

A couple of things stand out:
* Jane and Kim appear to be emailing the most people.
* There are basically two separate networks, which are both only connected by
an email between Jane and Kim.
* Tim and John have emailed a lot with each other.

## Digging deeper into the data

Click on a node to display its details. Here you can view all of the fields of
this specific email, such as the date, subject and body. It might be an
interesting one, since this is the email linking both networks together.

![Node details](/assets/articles/how-to-use-marija/node-details.png)

Now deselect the node by clicking on empty space anywhere in the graph. Open the
`Table` and click on `Select all nodes`. You will now see the table display all
nodes. `Subject` is currently the only selected column. We can add more columns by opening
the data of a node, and clicking on the plus icon.

{% include loopingVideo.html src="/assets/articles/how-to-use-marija/table-columns.mp4" %}

If we need a list of every email address that has sent an email, we can use the
`Unique values` screen. Open it, click on `Select all nodes`, and select the
`from` field.

## Inspecting the timeline

Learning when certain emails are sent can also be interesting in our research.
We can use the `Timeline` for this, open it by clicking on the `Timeline` button.
In the chart we can see how many emails are sent each day.

Hover on a chart bar to highlight the emails, and click to select them. After
having selected them, you could open up the `Table` to further inspect these emails.

By clicking on the `Play` button we can get a rough idea of the chronology of
emails.

{% include loopingVideo.html src="/assets/articles/how-to-use-marija/timeline.mp4" %}

Something interesting stands out here. First all communication was in the
top-right network, and then — after the connecting email from Jane to Kim —
the bottom-left network started messaging as well.

## Wrapping up

We learned how to use some basic features of Marija:
* Importing a CSV.
* The difference between objects (circles) and connectors (squares).
* Defining connectors manually.
* Inspecting our data with the `Table` and `Values` windows.
* Getting insights into the chronology of events with the `Timeline` window.

Marija is a powerful tool that can you help you find relations in your data
quickly. We demonstrated how data can be imported into Marija without needing
lots of preparation. We hope you enjoyed this tutorial. Happy graphing!
